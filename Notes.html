<h1> Beginning Concepts </h1>

<h2> World Wide Web </h2>
<!--Example of simple markups-->
  <p>
    The World Wide Web is a componet of the Internet and is a system of servers
    that communicate with each other formatted documents. These formated documents
    are coded in <em> Hypertext Markup Language</em> ("HTML").
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many types of files on the web, including: <b>plain text, HTML, images, videos and music</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The major pieces are you, your computer running a web browser, the Internet, and servers. Your browser makes requests via the Internet to servers. These requests are using a protocol called HTTP. And the servers respond with files that the browser displays.
  </p>

<h2> Basic HTML Elements</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike people using natural langauge, computers can't make inferences and so they interpret language literally. Computer programming languages are designed to limit ambiguity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The basic form for HTML Markup is: <code> <b>&lt;[NAME]> Contents &lt;/[NAME]></b>.</code>
  </p>

<h2> HTML Attributes</h2>

  <p>
    An HTML attribute is a modifier of an HTML element. An attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types. Attributes always have values. A common attribute is a web address that becomes a <em>hypertext link</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The basic form to create a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">weblink</a> using the anchor tag is:
  <p>
  <p><code> <b>&lt;[a] href="[www.WEBADDRESS.com]"> DISPLAY TEXT &lt;/a></b>.</code> <!--When displaying HTML tags as text, start the tag with "&lt;".-->
  </p>

  <p>  <!--Example of code to insert and resize an image inline with text.-->
    HTML images appear inline <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5.gif" height="20" alt="Inline Skate"</img>
    with text by using a tag with serveral attributes.
  </p>

<h2> More HTML Elements</h2>
  <p>
    Elements can be <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Inline elements occurn withing the line of the text. A block element will draw an invisible block around the text and create whitespace around it. The block is configurable with attributes. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOh9WjucNsA"> video</a> explaning the difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Text can be broken up by using SPAN and DIV. Span is <em>inline</em> and DIV is <em>block</em>. Using SPAN allows inline assignment of attributes to text. Using DIV will create a block, by starting a new line and adding white space before and after the new line/text.
  </p>

<h2>HTML Document Structure</h2>
  <p>
    Writing code that people can easily read is a VERY important idea in computer programming. And a huge part of writing good code is structuring it well. In HTML, the indentation level increases when an idea begins and decreases when an idea is finished. If this is a bit confusing, let's look at an example:
  </p>

<h2>Tips for Coding</h2>

  <p>
    It's important to write code that is neat and formatted.
  </p>
  <div> <!--Using DIV to make the list tighter and not have whitespace between lines.-->
    1. Use <b>tabs</b> instead of spaces.
  </div>
  <div>
    2. Comment code when writing it.
  </div>
  <div>
    3. Use whitespace to make code readable.
  </div>
  <div>
    4. Before taking a break from a project, create a detailed comment of where you left off.
